    <h1>Privacy Policy — Tilda Image Uploader</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-11-06</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Tilda Image Uploader is a small Chrome extension that helps transfer images from Figma URLs to the Tilda upload
      API and updates image references inside the Tilda editor. The extension does not collect or transmit personal user
      data to third-party analytics or storage services.
    </p>

    <h2>What data the extension accesses</h2>
    <p>
      The extension operates inside the Tilda editor page and accesses only the information necessary to complete the
      upload flow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Public image URLs present in page elements (for example Figma-hosted URLs found in attributes like
        <code>data-field-bgimg-value</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Page-scoped variables exposed by the Tilda editor (for example <code>Tildaupload_PUBLICKEY</code> and
        <code>Tildaupload_UPLOADKEY</code>) so it can call the Tilda upload API from the page context.
      </li>
      <li>
        Temporary UI state stored locally (optional) using the browser's extension storage to improve UX (no personal
        data).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network requests and servers</h2>
    <p>
      The extension performs POST requests to the Tilda upload endpoint:
      <code>https://upload.tildacdn.com/api/upload/</code> to transfer image data and receive a CDN URL in response. It
      does not forward image data to any other third-party servers or analytics platforms.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention & storage</h2>
    <p>
      No user-identifying data is collected or stored on external servers by this extension. Any minimal settings saved
      with the extension storage remain in the user's browser and are not transmitted.
    </p>

    <h2>Security & remote code</h2>
    <p>
      All JavaScript shipped with the extension is packaged inside the extension bundle. The extension does not download
      and execute external JavaScript code at runtime. Network requests are limited to the domains required for
      operation (Tilda upload API, Tilda editor pages and public image URLs).
